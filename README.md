### Autodidact |  Perspective is Everything

---

Greetings, I go by Aly and I am currently open to work. I‚Äôm adaptable and always looking for learning opportunities that will enhance my skills & boost my experience. Consistently expanding my knowledge and experience in the industry, I seek opportunities that are exciting and will continue to build on my non-traditional background. Currently I am seeking roles that allow me to leverage my recent experience as an integrations engineer. I am striving to continue building my experience in a technical support or integrations engineer position.

In my latest position I was an Integrations Engineer for a payment management platform known as BillGO. My role evolved around site reliability as I monitored the health of existing integrations as well as prioritized high-impact solutions as part of my day to day. I built, tested, and maintained automated integrations while implementing JS, CSS, & HTML. I created plans and calculations to integrate applications across various product teams as well as evaluate existing components or systems to determine integration requirements to ensure final solutions meet my teams organizational needs.

üëæ Before my employment with BillGO I was a full-time teaching assistant at a coding boot camp - Coding Dojo. The same one I attended and received my certificate. I made the most of my pandemic isolation by taking a chance on myself and my career and pursuing programming full-time. My boot camp experience covered full stack development through Javascript, Python, and C#. I have experience and knowledge with OOP and the foundational core concepts involved in programming. Since leaving my position in the direct line of healthcare, I have found my passion in the software industry. Regardless of my field, my drive to help others in unique ways has always been my fuel that propels me forward.

üöÄ Upon completing my studies with Coding Dojo, I wanted to take my skill set further. A non-profit, Year Up, allowed me to blossom and hone in on my career path and interests as a developer. Since completion, I have been polishing my professionalism and personal brand. Through Year Up, I earned a full-time intership with Tableau / Salesforce that provided me with industry-level experience collaborting with a team of engineers and UX/UI designers. It's often difficult to take on the industry without obtaining a bachelor's degree, but I'm here to prove it's possible. 

‚úàÔ∏è Outside of being online, I love to unplug and travel the world. Diversity has always been crucial in my life, and I look forward to always working with a team and company with that same sense of eccentric community. I am an active member of the outdoors - you can find me hiking, biking, running, snowboarding, wakeboarding or mountain biking all depedning on the season. I indulge in photography or just taking it easy with my two dogs Snowball & Astra. I currently work remote which has given me the bliss of working in some of the most beautiful settings.

‚öîÔ∏è Follow my journey and progress in the industry, and feel free to reach out anytime. I greatly appreciate any advice and direction.
