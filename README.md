### Autodidact |  Perspective is Everything

---
Greetings, my name is Aly, and I am currently seeking exciting new employment opportunities in the technical support or customer success realm. With a strong desire to enhance my skills and experience, I am keen to explore avenues that allow me to leverage my recent experience.

In my most recent position, I worked as a Site Reliability Engineer at BillGO INC, a bill pay software for fintech and financial institutions. My responsibilities included developing automated processes for data extraction, loading, and transformation, as well as integrating web data into databases to support customer-facing applications using the .NET framework. I collaborated with team members to streamline integrations across various product teams and documented integration procedures, troubleshooting techniques, and best practices for knowledge sharing and growth. As I handled various test and bug issues through support tickets and system health monitoring, I focused on addressing the most critical system issues.

My strong communication and interpersonal skills proved invaluable in collaborating with team members and clients to ensure successful integration deployments that adhered to proper risk assessment protocols and maintained secure user data.

Before BillGO, my experience as a teaching assistant at the Coding Dojo boot camp, where I also received my certification, provided me with a solid foundation in full-stack development through HTML/CSS, Javascript/React, and Python/Flask. I also showcased my expertise in algorithmic programming solutions and data structures to a diverse group of students with varying backgrounds and experience levels. 

Furthermore, my participation in the non-profit program Year Up enabled me to gain industry-level experience collaborating with a team of engineers and UX/UI designers during my full-time internship at Tableau. At Tableau, I focused on front-end development using React and TypeScript. I supported the engineering and design team for UI/UX and made customer-facing improvements to the Tableau Prep application. I debugged, refactored, and tested code to ensure maximum efficiency and quality of the application. Throughout my internship, I worked alongside a senior-level engineer and gained experience in best practices through utilizing Jira, and scrum protocols such as product backlogging, sprint planning, reviews, and live demonstrations. I demonstrated my front-end expertise in three separate deployments and resolved over 50 support tickets.

When I'm not working, I enjoy traveling, hiking, biking, running, snowboarding, wakeboarding, or mountain biking depending on the season. I am also a passionate photographer and enjoy spending time with my two dogs, Snowball and Astra. Currently, I work remotely, which has allowed me to work in some of the most beautiful settings (currently editing this from BC, drinking tea, and watching the sunset).

Please do not hesitate to reach out to me if you have any advice or direction to offer.

Cheers and thanks for swinging by.
