### Learning through trial & error. Often not by choice. 😉

### 🖖 Thanks for swinging by!

👾 I'm currently a newer face in the industry but have some really neat things in route. I'm coming up on a year as a full time teaching assistant at a local Seattle bootcamp - Coding Dojo. I made the most of my pandemic shut-in by attending and graduating from this same bootcamp in 2020. I left my position in the direct line of healthcare to switch career fields but hope to return someday with my new skill set addition. My drive to help others in unique ways has always been the backbone to my motivation of work.

🚀 Upon graduating from Coding Dojo I wanted to take my skill set farther. Just this year I applied and was accepted into a nationwide program known as Year Up. The non-profit has given me the opportunity to truly blossom and hone in on my career path and interests as a developer. Since being accepted six months ago I have been polishing my professionalism and personal brand as well as being given the exciting opportunity to intern with Tableau for the following six months. It's often difficult to get over the wall of not obtaining a bachelor's degree in the industry but I'm here to prove it's possible. 

👩‍💻 My bootcamp experience covered fullstack development through Javascript, Python and C#. I have experience and knowledge with OOP and the foundational core concepts involved in coding regardless of the language. More personally, in my free time I've been researching data analytics and how to manipulate data in unique ways. Catching my eye I've been focusing on Python, and SQL.

✈️ Outside of being online, I love to unplug and travel the world. My more recent trips have been very local, outdoors, and socially distanced but my history of experiencing new cultures, traditions and especially new foods has made me the eccentric wild card I am today. Diversity has always been extremely important to me and I am looking forward to one day being a part of a team that holds strong to this as well. 

⚔️ Follow my journey and progress in the industry and feel free to reach out anytime, I greatly appreciate any advice and direction. 
With everything going on I am not currently looking to collaborate on projects but will notify when that gate has opened once again.

### 😷 Stay safe and happy coding!
