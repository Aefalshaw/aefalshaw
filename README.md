### FullStack Ahead | Autodidact & Ambivert | Perspective is Everything

---

Greetings, I go by Aly and I am currently an Integrations Engineer for a payment management platform known as BillGO. My role evolves around a lot of site reliability engineering as I monitor the health of existing integrations and prioritize high-impact solutions as part of my day to day. I deliver straightforward integrations with a variety of existing toolsets and develop plans and calculations to integrate applications across various product teams. I also evaluate existing components or systems to determine integration requirements to ensure final solutions meet organizational needs. I share a great passion with my team for being able to contribute towards a product that makes lives eaiser for those in the financial industry.

üëæ Before my employment with BillGO I was a full-time teaching assistant at a coding boot camp - Coding Dojo. I made the most of my pandemic shut-in by taking a chance on myself and my career and pursuing programming full-time. I left my position in the direct line of healthcare and have found my passion in the software industry. Regardless, my drive to help others in unique ways has always been the backbone of my motivation for work.

üöÄ Upon completing Coding Dojo's program myself, I wanted to take my skill set further. A non-profit, Year Up, has allowed me to blossom and hone in on my career path and interests as a developer. Since completion, I have been polishing my professionalism and personal brand. Through Year Up, I earned a full-time intership with Tableau that provided me with industry-level experience collaborting with a team of engineers and UX/UI designers. It's often difficult to take on the industry without obtaining a bachelor's degree, but I'm here to prove it's possible. 

üë©‚Äçüíª My boot camp experience covered full stack development through Javascript, Python, and C#. I have experience and knowledge with OOP and the foundational core concepts involved in programming. More personally, in my free time, I've been researching data analytics and how to manipulate data in unique ways. Catching my eye, I've been focusing on Python and SQL relating to data interpretation.

‚úàÔ∏è Outside of being online, I love to unplug and travel the world. Diversity has always been crucial in my life, and I look forward to always working with a team and company with that same sense of eccentric community. I am an active member of the outdoors - you can find me hiking, biking, running, snowboarding, wakeboarding or mountain biking all depedning on the season.

‚öîÔ∏è Follow my journey and progress in the industry, and feel free to reach out anytime. I greatly appreciate any advice and direction.
